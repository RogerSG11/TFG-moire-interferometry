## Simulation of a phase-grating Moiré Interferometer for light and matter waves and its application to precision measurements

Codes for the final research project (TFG) for the degree in Engineering Physics + Informatics Engineering at CFIS-UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain). Research conducted under the supervision of J. Boronat (UPC) and D. Pushin (IQC - Institute for Quantum Computing, Waterloo, Canada).

### Contents

- **diffractio**: documentation and examples for the *diffractio* Python package, used as a reference for optical wave simulation.
- **neutron_original**: original code from C. Kapahi (IQC) to simulate neutron diffraction.
- **optical_wave_diffraction**: code for simulation of diffraction of optical waves, both in 1D and 2D. Contains the optwavepckg module as well as a number of scripts using it.
- **neutron_diffraction**: code for simulation of diffraction of neutron matter waves (in 1D). Containts the neutronpckg module and some scripts used for the project.
