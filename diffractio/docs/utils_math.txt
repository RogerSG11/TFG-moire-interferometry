Common functions to classes

Functions:
    - distance: distance between two vectors
    - nearest: nearest element in vector to number
    - nearest2: nearest elements in vector to numbers
    - find_extrema: in a 2D-array, the maxima and minima are found
    - ndgrid: n-dimensional gridding like Matlab's NDGRID
    - get_amplitude: gets the amplitude of the field
    - get_phase: gets the phase of the field [exp(i*phi)]
    - amplitude2phase: u = A*exp(i*phi) -> exp(i*abs(A))
    - phase2amplitude: passes phase of a complex field to amplitude
    - normalize: normalize vectors with different L norm (standard is 2)
    - binarize: binarizes vector between two levels, min and max. Centra value is (min+max)/2
    - discretize: discretize in a given number of levels
    - delta_kronecker: delta(a,b) = 1 if a==b else 0
    - vector_product: vector product between two vectors (size 3x1)
    - dot_product: dot product between two vectors (size 3x1)
    - divergence: divergence of a field at a given point (3D cartesian coordinates)
    - curl: curl of a field at a given point (3D cartesian coordinates)
    - get_edges: locations of edges of binary mask (for litography engraving of gratings)
    - cut_function: takes values of function inside range
    - fft_convolution2d: 2D convolution using FFT
    - fft_convolution1d: 1D convolution using FFT
    - fft_filter: 1D convolution, using fft
    - fft_correlation1d: 1D correlation, using FFT
    - fft_correlation2d: 2D correlation, using FFT
    - rotate_image: rotate image from given point
    - cart2pol: cartesia to pola coordinate transformation
    - pol2cart: polar to cartesian coordinate transformation
    - fZernike: Zernike function for aberration computation
    - laguerre_polynomial_nk: auxiliar laguerre polynomial of orders n and k
    - get_k: provides k vector from x vector (ordered or disordered)
    - filter_edge_1D: function 1 at center and reduced at borders, for propagation algorithms
